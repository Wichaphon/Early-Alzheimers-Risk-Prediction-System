## 💡 Features
- 🖥️ **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive web application for users to input their health data.
- 🔮 **Predictive Model**: Powered by machine learning algorithms that predict the likelihood of Alzheimer's risk.
- 📊 **Risk Assessment**: Provides an estimate of Alzheimer's risk based on input data.
- 📈 **Data Visualization**: Displays results and insights in easy-to-understand graphical formats.

## 📖 How It Works
- The system collects **health-related data** (such as age, medical history, lifestyle factors) from users.
- **Machine learning models** analyze the data and predict the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
- The results are displayed in an easy-to-understand interface, giving users an estimate of their **Alzheimer's risk**.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
